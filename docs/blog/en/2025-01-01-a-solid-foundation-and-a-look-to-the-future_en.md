# How to Build Your Best Future 🏗️

**📅 Original date: March 30, 2025**

Hi Inner Journe[2025-01-01-a-step-into-the-unknown-what-happens-when-we-dare-to-dream-big_en.md](2025-01-01-a-step-into-the-unknown-what-happens-when-we-dare-to-dream-big_en.md)y community! 👋

What do you do when you're building a house and realize the blueprints are a bit too ambitious? You strengthen the foundation and keep building – one room at a time. That's exactly what we've done with *Inner Journey* this month.

Since launching on March 1st, we've gone from a blank slate to a prototype with steady legs. But there's a detail here that made us pause and smile: our app is starting to feel like a friend. 😊

## Building a Home for the Journey 🏡

Ten days ago, we wrote about how the code came to life – a first “Hello” from `Google Gemini` 🤖 that gave us goosebumps. Since then, we've worked hard. `Backlog 5` (dated March 23rd) shows the progress: a backend with endpoints like `/astro-data` and `/phone/verify`, a frontend starting to take shape, and a clearer structure.

But we still had too many ideas – `Sinch`, `Dialogflow`, `VedAstro` – threatening to topple the construction. So we simplified.

Our tech stack now looks like this:
*   **Backend:** A `FastAPI` app 🐍 running on `Google Cloud Run` ☁️, containerized with `Docker` 🐳.
*   **Data Storage:** `Firebase Firestore` 🔥 handles the data.
*   **AI Insights:** `Google Gemini` 🤖 provides personalized insights.
*   **Frontend:** Built with `React` ⚛️ and `Chakra UI`, deployed on `Firebase Hosting`.

No more juggling too many balls – just a stable foundation to build upon. 💪

## 'Welcome Back!' 🎉

Here's what made us smile: after deploying to `Google Cloud Run` and `Firebase Hosting`, we ran a test. We logged in (still only locally), sent an API call, and got back: “Welcome back! Your next step is to breathe deeply for five minutes.”

It wasn't just a technical victory – it felt like *Inner Journey* was greeting us, like a friend who remembers you. That feeling is exactly what we want to give you, our users. ❤️

## Lessons Learned This Month 💡

*   🎯 **Focus Beats Everything**: Cutting out extra tools (goodbye, `Sinch` for now! 👋) gave us time to polish what really counts.
*   ✅ **Testing is Vital**: The requirements for documentation and tests from `Backlog 4` saved us from drowning in bugs. 🐛➡️✅
*   ✨ **Simple is Beautiful**: A form instead of voice calls (decision from `Backlog 5`) showed that less can often be more effective.

## The Future Beckons ✨

We have a house with a strong foundation – but it still lacks furniture. The backend needs proper authentication (`Firebase UID` is the next step), and the frontend needs pages for login and displaying results. Maybe we'll pick up the astrology part again a bit later. 🔮

But right now? We're proud. The prototype isn't just code – it's a starting point for *your* journey. 🚀
