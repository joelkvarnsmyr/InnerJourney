# Discover AI Projects on GitHub 🧭

## Introduction: Our Method at Inner Journey

At Inner Journey, we have developed an effective and structured method for managing our project "Inner Journey MoSCoW" using `GitHub Projects`. Our setup is a combination of prioritization, roadmap, sprints, and iterations – all gathered on a platform that is both clear and flexible.

In this post, we share our process, explain why we chose `GitHub Projects`, and show how this can inspire others to improve their project management. ✨

## Why GitHub Projects? 🤔

When choosing a project management tool, we looked at several options, such as `Jira`, `Trello`, and `Asana`, but settled on `GitHub Projects` for several reasons:

*   **🔗 Integrated with the codebase:** Since our code is already on GitHub, it's convenient to have project management in the same place.
*   **🤸 Flexibility:** With custom fields, we can tailor the tool to our needs.
*   **💰 Cost-effective:** `GitHub Projects` is free for our team, unlike many other tools that require expensive licenses.
*   **👌 Simplicity:** It's intuitive and requires minimal training, which saves time.

## Our Setup: An Overview 📊

We have built a structure that combines several important parts to drive the project forward effectively:

### Prioritization with MoSCoW

We use the `MoSCoW` method (**Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have**) to prioritize tasks. This ensures that we focus on what is absolutely necessary to achieve our goals.🎯

### Roadmap and Sprints 🗺️

Each card in `GitHub Projects` is linked to a specific sprint and iteration. This gives us a clear roadmap and makes it easy to track progress over time.

### Iterations 🔄

We work in two-week iterations, which allows us to deliver functional parts of the product regularly and adapt the plan based on feedback.

### Custom Fields 🏷️

To get a detailed overview, we have added fields such as:
*   `Priority`
*   `Size`
*   `Estimate`
*   `User Value`
*   `Dependencies`

This facilitates both planning and decision-making.

## Why This Is a Good Setup ✅

Our structure has several strengths that make it ideal for us – and potentially for others:

*   **👀 Clarity:** The `MoSCoW` method and prioritization fields make it crystal clear what the team should focus on.
*   **🤸 Flexibility:** Custom fields and iterative work allow us to quickly change plans if priorities shift.
*   **🤝 Transparency:** Everyone on the team has access to the same information, which reduces misunderstandings and strengthens collaboration.
*   **⚡ Efficiency:** By having project management integrated with the codebase, we avoid switching between different tools.

## How We Chose Between Different Systems 🤔

We evaluated several options before deciding:

*   **`Jira`:** Too advanced and costly for our smaller team.
*   **`Trello`:** Too basic – lacks the depth we need for technical projects.
*   **`Asana`:** Good for task management, but lacks integration with our codebase.
*   **`GitHub Projects`:** Offers a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality, plus it's tightly integrated with our code. 🥇

## Conclusion 🚀

With `GitHub Projects`, we have created a project management structure that combines `MoSCoW` prioritization, sprints, iterations, and custom fields in a way that is both clear and adaptable.

This setup has optimized our work on "Inner Journey MoSCoW" and can be a source of inspiration for other teams – especially those looking for an integrated solution for code and project management. If you are a manager or project lead looking for an effective method for technical projects, this could be an avenue to explore. 👍
