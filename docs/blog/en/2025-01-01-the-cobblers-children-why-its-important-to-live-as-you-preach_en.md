# How Do You Strengthen Your Integrity? 🧭

Hello, `Inner Journey` community! 👋

Imagine a chef who never tastes their own food 👨‍🍳 or a personal trainer who never lifts a dumbbell 🏋️‍♀️. It feels wrong, right? That's exactly what the old saying "the shoemaker's children" is about – the shoemaker's children going barefoot while others get shoes 👞.

At `Inner Journey`, we believe it's crucial to practice what we preach, especially when building a platform for personal development and well-being. But what does that mean in practice for us, and why is it so important? Let's dive in. 🏊‍♂️

## 🤔 A Mirror to Ourselves

When we started `Inner Journey`, we had a vision: to create tools that help people grow in a simple and honest way. But one day it struck us – if we don't use the tools we build ourselves, how can we stand behind them?

It was like holding up a mirror 🪞 and realizing we risked becoming the shoemaker's children – those who fix shoes for others but forget their own feet. That thought became a wake-up call ⏰: practicing what we preach isn't just a nice idea; it's the foundation of our credibility and authenticity.

## ✨ Why It's Important

The saying "the shoemaker's children" points to a simple truth: it's easy to prioritize others before yourself, especially when you're an expert at something. For us at `Inner Journey`, this means that we as a team must live by the principles we promote.

If we encourage you to reflect, set goals, and take care of yourselves, then we must do the same. It's about building trust – if we don't believe in our own tools, why should you? 🤔

But it doesn't stop there. When we go through the journey ourselves – with its ups and downs – we gain a deeper understanding of what you, our users, experience. This makes us not just guides, but fellow travelers on the same path. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️

## ✅ How We Practice What We Preach

At `Inner Journey`, we are not just creators of the platform – we are users just like you. Here are some examples of how we practice what we preach:

-   📝 **`Dynamic Journal`**: We use our own journal to reflect on our days. Sometimes we write about a successful sprint, sometimes about a stressful week. It's not always perfect, but it's honest – and it helps us grow.
-   🤝 **Coaching**: We put ourselves in the client's seat sometimes. Receiving guidance reminds us how powerful it is to be seen and heard.
-   🛠️ **Tools in daily life**: During an intense period before the MVP launch, one of us lost focus. Instead of just pushing through, he used the platform's breathing exercises and took a moment for reflection. It served as a reminder that our tools aren't just for you – they're for us too.

## 🚧 When Things Don't Go Smoothly

Let's be honest: we stumble sometimes. 😅 There are days when deadlines make us skip a reflection or forget to pause.

But we've learned that it's not about being perfect – it's about trying, catching ourselves, and getting back on track. Just as we encourage you to do when life gets messy. When we miss the mark, it becomes a chance to learn something new, and that strengthens both us and the platform. 💪

## 🤝 A Shared Journey

So, as you take your next steps on your inner journey, remember that we are walking alongside you. We're not just here to guide – we're on the same path, with our own challenges and victories. Avoiding becoming like the shoemaker's children is a daily reminder for us: practicing what we preach is what makes `Inner Journey` what it is. ✨
