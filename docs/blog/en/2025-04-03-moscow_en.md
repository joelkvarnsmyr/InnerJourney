# Living Project Management: Inner Journey's Method for Safety and Collaboration 🧭

In a world where projects often feel like a roller coaster, we at Inner Journey have created a structure that makes the journey both safe and collaborative. We have built a living process where the team can gather, evaluate, and improve – all to create a work environment where everyone feels safe and engaged.

Here, we share our methodology, the fields we use, and an example of what it can look like, so you can be inspired to shape your own process.

## A Living Document for Living Projects 📄

Projects are not static – they change constantly. That's why we have built a structure that is dynamic and living. By using `GitHub Projects` as a central hub, we can:

-   **Update plans in real-time:** Everyone sees changes immediately, reducing the risk of misunderstandings.
-   **Discuss and adapt:** The team can comment on and re-evaluate tasks continuously.

This creates safety in the work environment, which is crucial for high-performing teams. According to research from Harvard Business Review (2019), psychological safety is one of the most important factors for effective teams, as it allows employees to dare to take risks and share ideas (HBR, 2019).

## User-Friendly Interfaces: The Key to Collaboration ✨

For a living document to work, it must be easy to use. We have chosen to structure our data in intuitive interfaces where the team can:

-   See status at a glance – are we on the right track? 👀
-   Update progress without hassle. ✅
-   Collaborate by discussing directly in the tool. 💬

This saves time and makes collaboration smooth. According to McKinsey (2020), user-friendly interfaces can increase productivity by up to 20%, as they reduce friction and make it easier to focus on what really matters (McKinsey, 2020).

## Our Fields: A Toolbox for Safety and Clarity 🛠️

We use 13 fields to keep track of everything important in the project. Here they are, presented as a toolbox to inspire you to create your own process:

1.  **`Status`**: Shows where a task is – from `"Backlog"` (waiting to start) to `"Done"` (finished!). It's like a GPS keeping us on the right course. 🗺️
2.  **`Sub-issues progress`**: A percentage bar (e.g., `40%` complete) showing how far we've progressed with sub-tasks. It's like a treasure map showing how close we are to the gold! 💰
3.  **`Priority`**: Marks what is most urgent – `P0` (highest priority), `P1`, or `P2`. Think of it as a compass pointing to what we should tackle first. 🔥
4.  **`Size`**: Estimates if a task is `"Small"`, `"Medium"`, or `"Large"`. It's like packing a bag – you know if you need a backpack or a whole suitcase. 🎒
5.  **`Estimate`**: A number (e.g., `8`, `10`, `15`) estimating how much time or effort a task takes. It's like calculating how many hours of wind we need to sail on. ⛵
6.  **`Iteration`**: Links tasks to time periods, e.g., `"Iteration 1: Apr 02 – Apr 15"`. It's like dividing the journey into chapters. 📖
7.  **`Start date`**: Sets the start date (e.g., `"2025-04-01"`). It's like having a travel planner keeping us on schedule. 🗓️
8.  **`End date`**: Sets the end date (e.g., `"2025-04-03"`). Keeps us on schedule. 🏁
9.  **`MoSCoW`**: Sorts tasks into `"Must have"`, `"Should have"`, `"Could have"`, and `"Won’t have"`. It's like packing for an expedition – you bring the tent before the disco ball. 🎯
10. **`User Value`**: A scale from 1 to 5 showing how much benefit a task provides the user. Think of it as a star review – we aim for five-star experiences! ⭐
11. **`Dependencies`**: Shows if a task depends on something else, e.g., `"None"` or `"Waiting for X"`. It's like checking the map for obstacles before sailing on. 🔗
12. **`Objective`**: Describes the goal, e.g., `"Ensure users can enter basic data"`. It's like having a "why" tattooed on the compass. 🧭
13. **`Team`**: Shows who is responsible – `"Dev"`, `"Design"`, `"Backend"`, `"Frontend"`, `"Admin"`, or `"Finance"`. It's like assigning roles to the crew. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

## Example: A General Card for All Projects 🃏

Here is an example of what a card might look like, regardless of the project you are running:

-   **Card**: "Develop a welcome screen for new users"
-   **`Status`**: `In progress` – we are in the middle of the work!
-   **`Sub-issues progress`**: `50%` – half of the sub-tasks are complete (e.g., the design is finished, but coding is ongoing).
-   **`Priority`**: `P1` – important, but not critical.
-   **`Size`**: `Medium` – it's a reasonable challenge.
-   **`Estimate`**: `12` – we estimate it will take 12 hours.
-   **`Iteration`**: `Iteration 2` – we'll do it in the next phase.
-   **`Start date`**: `2025-04-16` – we start then.
-   **`End date`**: `2025-04-20` – it should be finished then.
-   **`MoSCoW`**: `Should have` – it's important, but not a must-have for launch.
-   **`User Value`**: `4` – users will love it!
-   **`Dependencies`**: `Waiting for "Design logo"` – we need that first.
-   **`Objective`**: Create a warm and inviting first experience for new users.
-   **`Team`**: `Design` and `Frontend` – they are taking the lead.

## Why This Creates Safety and Collaboration ✅

Our structure is more than just fields – it's a method for continuously evaluating, re-evaluating, and improving. The team can:

-   **See the big picture:** All fields provide a clear overview of what's happening. 📊
-   **Work together:** By discussing and updating in real-time, everyone becomes involved. 🤝
-   **Feel safe:** A study from Gallup (2021) shows that engaged teams are 21% more productive and profitable, and a safe work environment is key (Gallup, 2021). ❤️

## Conclusion: Make Your Process Living 🚀

Project management is about creating an environment where the team can flourish. With a living structure like ours – where the fields are tools for collaboration and safety – you can do just that.

Take inspiration from our fields, shape them to your needs, and see how your project becomes a place where everyone wants to be part of the journey!
