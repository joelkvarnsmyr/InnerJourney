# How Do You Fund the Dream? 💰

📅 **Date:** March 31, 2025

Hi Inner Journey friends! 👋

Imagine standing before a treasure chest, ready to fill it with gold to realize a vision – but instead of a shovel, you have a handful of spoons in different sizes. Which one do you choose? 🤔 That's where we find ourselves right now with *Inner Journey*.

Our prototype is ticking, our idea is shining ✨, but to take the next step, we need to find the best cups to scoop funding from.

We have a plan to raise `SEK 2.23 million` – and we'd love to hear your thoughts on how we should do it! 🎯

## A Million-SEK Idea Waiting for Wings ✨

Last week, we tested our *MVP* (`Most Viable Product`) – entered birth data and got back: “Your next step is to breathe deeply and set an intention.” It was magical – as if the app whispered to us. 🙏

But then reality hit: building and running this for a year costs `SEK 1.86 million`, and with a buffer, we land at `SEK 2.23 million`. We expect to earn `SEK 594,000` from users in year one, but that still leaves `SEK 1.64 million` to find.

That's our treasure hunt – and we have a map full of possibilities! 🗺️

## Our Vision Requires Resources 💸

*Inner Journey* isn't just an app – it's an AI-driven friend that blends insights from astrology, voice interaction, and self-help to guide you towards better well-being. To launch our *MVP* in September and keep it running for a year, we need:

*   💻 **Development:** `SEK 931,730` (includes developers, designer, services like `Firebase`, and the `innerjourney.com` domain).
*   ⚙️ **Operations:** `SEK 926,880` (includes servers, support, and calculated for `1000 users/month`).
*   🛡️ **Buffer:** `SEK 371,722` as a buffer for unexpected turns and challenges.

But how do we fill these cups? We have some ideas – and we'd love to bounce them off you!

## Local Treasures: Sweden and Gotland 🇸🇪🏝️

We're starting close to home. Think of these as small, steady cups we can fill drop by drop:

*   🔬 **`Vinnova`**: Sweden's innovation agency. Potential: up to `SEK 465,865` to boost our AI and health focus. A perfect start for the development costs!
*   📈 **`Tillväxtverket`**: Potential: `SEK 200,000–500,000` to put Gotland on the map as a healthtech hub.
*   🏘️ **`Region Gotland`**: Potential: `SEK 100,000–300,000` to strengthen local growth – we are proud Gotlanders, after all!
*   ❤️ **`The Kamprad Family Foundation`**: Here we see a larger cup. Potential: `SEK 500,000–1 million`, as our practical approach to well-being might resonate with their heart.

Together, these local sources can give us up to `SEK 1.77 million`. But we don't want to stop here – the world is calling!

## International Adventures: EU and Beyond 🌍🇪🇺

Now we bring out the big cups – the ones that can hold entire lakes:

*   🇪🇺 **`Horizon Europe`**: The EU's giant program for health and digitalization. Can cover `70–80%` of our costs – up to `SEK 1.78 million`! What if we could collaborate with European healthtech partners?
*   🔗 **`Interreg Europe`**: Same potential (up to `SEK 1.78 million`) if we find the right cross-border friends.
*   🏦 **`World Bank Group`**: Potential: `SEK 500,000–2 million` to reach new markets – perhaps a long-term dream for year two?

These could become our backbone – but they require time, partnerships, and a strong application. Is it worth aiming so high already?

## Private Capital: Gold from Angels 😇💰

Then we have the shiny cups – private capital from investors who believe in us:

*   💰 **`Creandum`**: A Swedish VC firm that could chip in `SEK 5.5–55 million` for our AI-driven future.
*   🌟 **`Techstars Health Accelerator`**: Offers `SEK 1.2 million` plus invaluable mentorship – perfect for polishing our product.
*   👼 **Business Angels**: Potential: `SEK 500,000–1.5 million` in exchange for shares in the company. Maybe a Gotlandic entrepreneur wants to jump on board?

Here it's about pitching right – showing that we can reach `break-even in 5.8 years` (or faster with tweaked pricing!).

## Crowdfunding: The People's Cup 🙌🚀

And then a wild thought: what if we turn to you – our users? A Kickstarter campaign with a goal of `SEK 100,000–500,000` where you get early access to *Inner Journey*.

Imagine funding us and testing the app at the same time – is it crazy or genius? 🤔

## Our Funding Mix – And Your Input! 🍹🤝

We dream of a funding cocktail: perhaps `SEK 465,865` from **`Vinnova`**, `SEK 300,000` from **`Tillväxtverket`**, `SEK 750,000` from **`The Kamprad Family Foundation`**, and `SEK 500,000` from an investor. That gives us `SEK 2.02 million` – almost all the way!

But which cup should we prioritize? Should we aim for the EU's giant funds now, or stay local and fast? And crowdfunding – are you on board with that?

We have an action plan for 2025: apply to **`Vinnova`** in `Q2`, launch the *MVP* in `Q3`, and pitch investors in `Q4`. But we don't want to do it alone – your ideas could be the gold we've missed!
