## 🎯 Overview

The onboarding process for Inner Journey is designed to quickly integrate new employees – including developers, coaches, and funding managers – into the project.

The goal is to provide them with a clear start, access to the right tools, and a sense of belonging in line with our vision of practical self-development without the fluff.

## 🏆 Goals of the Onboarding

*   🤝 Provide new employees with a smooth introduction to Inner Journey's culture, tools, and workflows.
*   ⚡ Ensure they can quickly contribute value, whether it's through code, coaching, or funding work.
*   💪 Create a sense of control and engagement from day one.

## 🚀 The Onboarding Process

### 📝 1. Preparation Before the First Day

        *   Overview of the first week.
        *   Link to the digital agreement (to be signed via an integrated tool in Inner Journey's system, e.g., `Paperbell` or `DocuSign` – TBD).
    *   Prepare technical setup or materials 🛠️:
        *   **Developers:** Instructions for installing `Python`, `React`, `Firebase`, and configuring `VedAstro` on `GCE` (`e2-medium instance`, 240 SEK/month).
