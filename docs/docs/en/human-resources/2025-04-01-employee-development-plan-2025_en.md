## 🎯 Overview

The Employee Development Plan for Inner Journey is designed to support the team's personal and professional growth. The plan aligns with the platform's mission of practical self-development.

This plan applies to all employees – including `developers`, `coaches`, and `funding managers`. The purpose is to strengthen both individual skills and the team's collective contribution to the project.

## 🌱 Goals of the Plan

The main goals of the plan are to:

-   Promote continuous development without "fluff," with a clear focus on concrete results.
-   Provide employees with tools and opportunities to grow in their roles and as individuals.
-   Build a culture where learning and reflection are a natural and integrated part of work.

## ⚙️ The Development Process

The employee development process follows these steps:

### 1. Individual Goals 🎯

-   **Timing:** Goals are initially set during onboarding and subsequently revised quarterly (`Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, `Q4`).
-   **Process:**
    -   Each employee defines 1-3 development goals in consultation with the project manager (e.g., Bo Joel Kvarnsmyr).
    -   The goals must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), and linked to both the employee's role and Inner Journey's overall needs.
-   **Examples per role:**
    -   👨‍💻 **Developer:** Learn to optimize `Firebase` databases for improved scalability by `Q2 2025`.
    -   🤝 **Coach:** Conduct at least 20 coaching sessions and achieve Senior Coach status within 6 months.
    -   💰 **Funding Manager:** Secure at least `465,865 SEK` in funding from Vinnova by May 2025 (see relevant documents).

### 2. Tools and Resources 🛠️

-   **The Platform:** Employees are encouraged to actively use Inner Journey's own tools, such as the `Dynamic Journal`, for personal reflection and goal tracking.
-   **Training:**
    -   `Developers`: Access to relevant online courses via platforms like `Udemy` or `Pluralsight` for topics such as `Python`, `React`, or `Firebase`.
    -   `Coaches`: Opportunity to participate in workshops or receive supervision from certified Senior Coaches within the project.
    -   `Funding Manager`: Access to resources on grant applications, such as `Vinnova's guidelines` and `EU Horizon guides`.
-   **Budget:** A budget of up to `5,000 SEK` per employee per year is allocated for external training and courses (the budget can be adjusted as needed and upon approval).

### 3. Support and Follow-up 💬

-   **Mentorship:** Informal mentorship is encouraged via `Slack`. Employees can ask questions and seek support from colleagues in relevant channels (`#dev`, `#coaching`, `#finance`).
-   **1:1 Meetings:** Quarterly follow-up meetings (approx. 30 minutes via `Slack` Huddles or equivalent) are held between the employee and the project manager to:
    -   Evaluate progress towards set goals.
    -   Identify any obstacles and new development needs.
    -   Give and receive constructive feedback.
-   **Timing:** These meetings are scheduled at the beginning of each new quarter (e.g., April, July, October, January).

### 4. Reflection and Adjustment 📝

-   **Method:** Employees are responsible for logging their progress and reflections on their development. This can be done in a personal document or by using the platform's `Dynamic Journal`.
-   **Frequency:** At least one structured reflection is recommended per quarter, for example, upon completion of goals or training.
-   **Purpose:** To promote self-awareness by identifying personal strengths, challenges, and defining next steps – without finger-pointing.

### 5. Recognition and Advancement ✨

-   **Recognition:** When employees achieve their development goals, this can be acknowledged internally, for example, via a mention in the `#general` `Slack` channel or through small perks (e.g., extra time off, gift cards, etc., at the project manager's discretion).
-   **Advancement:** Performance and development can lead to new opportunities:
    -   `Developers`: Opportunity to take lead responsibility for specific technical sub-projects after demonstrating competence and initiative.
    -   `Coaches`: Opportunity for certification as a Senior Coach after approximately 6 months of experience and at least 20 completed sessions (see separate criteria).
    -   `Funding Manager`: Upon successful applications, opportunity for expanded responsibility for larger and more complex funding projects (e.g., Horizon Europe).

## 💡 Specific Examples per Role

### Developer 👨‍💻
