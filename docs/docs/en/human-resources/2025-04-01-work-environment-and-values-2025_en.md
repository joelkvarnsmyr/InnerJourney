## 📜 Overview

The Work Environment and Values for Inner Journey define how we work together as a team – including developers, coaches, and finance managers – and how we ensure an environment that promotes both productivity and well-being.

This document reflects our mission of practical self-development and serves as a foundation for the team's culture, whether we work remotely or in physical meetings.

## 🎯 Goals for the Work Environment

Our primary goals for the work environment are to:

-   🚀 Create a **flexible and supportive environment** that encourages results without unnecessary stress.
-   🤝 Anchor our **values in daily work** to strengthen team engagement.
-   🌱 Ensure that all employees **thrive and can grow**, in line with Inner Journey's philosophy.

## 💖 Our Values

These core values guide our daily work and decision-making:

### 💡 Practical Focus

We prioritize **concrete solutions and results** over vague ideas.

-   **Example:** Instead of long meetings, we test a solution directly and then evaluate it.

### 👂 User-Centric

Everything we do aims to **help users** on their journey.

-   **Example:** Feedback from the community weighs heavily in our decisions.

### 📢 Transparency

We communicate **openly about progress, challenges, and plans**.

-   **Example:** The finance manager shares the status of applications in the `#general` Slack channel.

### 🧪 Curiosity

We encourage **learning and testing new tools** or methods.

-   **Example:** Developers get time to experiment with new technical solutions.

## 🏗️ Structure of the Work Environment

We have structured our work environment around the following principles:

### Flexible Work 🕰️

-   **Remote Work:** Inner Journey is primarily a distributed team focused on flexibility. Employees choose where and when they work, as long as deadlines are met.
-   **Recommended Core Hours:** For collaboration, availability between 10:00–14:00 (Swedish time, adjusted as needed) is recommended.
-   **Tools:** 🛠️
    -   `Slack` for daily communication (main channels: `#general`, `#dev`, `#coaching`, `#finance`).
    -   `Inner Journey's platform` for individual reflection and goal tracking.
    *   Digital signing via integrated tool (e.g., `Paperbell` or `DocuSign`).

### Team Well-being 🧘

We prioritize the team's health and well-being through:

-   **Initiatives:** ❤️
    -   Regular 1:1 meetings (quarterly via `Slack` or video) to address individual needs and potential stress.
    -   Access to Inner Journey's own tools (e.g., meditation, Dynamic Journal) for personal balance.
    -   Voluntary virtual "coffee breaks" ☕ on `Slack` to strengthen community.
-   **Support:** In case of perceived overload, tasks can be redistributed after discussion with the project manager or the nearest colleague.

### Communication and Collaboration 💬

Effective collaboration is built on clear communication:

-   **Guidelines:** 🗣️
    -   Keep all conversations clear, constructive, and respectful (see [Communication Guide - LINK MISSING]).
    -   Use `Slack` for quick questions and updates. Longer discussions or complex topics are best handled in a short video call.
    -   Document important decisions and progress in relevant project or meeting notes (e.g., [Project X Notes - LINK MISSING]).
-   **Meetings:** We strive for a minimal number of meetings. Team updates happen asynchronously via `Slack` or in short weekly meetings (max 1 hour).

### Work-Life Balance ⚖️

We respect the boundary between work and private life:

-   **Policy:** 🧘‍♀️ No expectation to be available or respond to messages outside agreed working hours, unless it concerns an acute situation defined in advance.
-   **Benefits:** 🎉
    -   Possibility of flexible time off when needed (e.g., after completing intensive sprints or projects).
    -   Up to 5 extra days off per year for personal development or recovery, by agreement.

## 🌱 Implementation in Daily Life

The values and work environment principles are integrated into our work through:

-   **Onboarding:** New team members are introduced to our culture, values, and work environment during onboarding (see [Onboarding Process - LINK MISSING]).
-   **Development Reviews:** Employees are encouraged to link their personal and professional goals to the team's values (see [Development Review Template - LINK MISSING]).
-   **Continuous Feedback:** The team's experiences and suggestions regarding the work environment are collected continuously via 1:1 meetings and dedicated `Slack` threads to enable constant improvements. 📈

## 🚀 Next Steps

-   The work environment and values will be formally evaluated after Q2 2025 to ensure they continue to meet the team's needs and support our goals.
-   Any adjustments or updates will be documented in the next version of this document (`work-environment-and-values.md`).
