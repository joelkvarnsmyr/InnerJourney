# 🎯 Performance Management and Feedback

## 🧭 Overview

Performance management and feedback for Inner Journey is designed to provide employees with clear guidance and support to achieve their goals, while ensuring the project progresses according to plan.

The process is simple, results-driven, and linked to our values of practical focus and transparency, with the goal of promoting both individual and collective success. 🌱

## 🏆 Goals of Performance Management

Our primary goals with this process are to:

- ✅ Provide employees with concrete tools to evaluate and improve their work.
- ✅ Create a culture of open feedback without finger-pointing.
- ✅ Link individual performance to Inner Journey's milestones (e.g., MVP launch, funding goals).

## ⚙️ Performance Management Process

The process follows these steps:

### 1. 📈 Goal Tracking

-   **Timing:** Quarterly (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), in line with the project roadmap.
-   **Method:**
    -   Employees follow up on their individual goals (set during onboarding or quarterly meetings).
    -   Progress is logged in a personal document or in the platform's `Dynamisk Journal`. 📝
-   **Examples:**
    -   **Developer:** "Implement `VedAstro API` on `GCE` by May 2025."
    -   **Coach:** "Guide 10 new users during Q3 2025."
    -   **Funding Manager:** "Secure 465,865 SEK from Vinnova by May 2025."

### 2. 🤝 1:1 Meetings

-   **Frequency:** Quarterly (approximately 30 minutes via `Slack` video call). 🗓️
-   **Responsible:** Project Manager (e.g., Bo Joel Kvarnsmyr) or a designated mentor.
-   **Agenda:** 📝
    -   **Evaluation:** How have the goals been achieved? What worked well and what was challenging? 🤔
    -   **Feedback:** Constructive feedback from both the employee and the manager.
    -   **Next Steps:** Adjust goals or identify support needs (e.g., training, reallocation of tasks). 🛠️
-   **Documentation:** A brief summary is shared via `Slack` DM and saved internally. 💾

### 3. 🗓️ Annual Evaluation

-   **Timing:** Q4 2025 (December), for the first time after the MVP launch.
-   **Process:**
    -   Review of the year's goals and achievements (based on quarterly 1:1 meetings and logged progress).
    -   Assessment of contribution to Inner Journey's overall progress (e.g., launch, funding, user growth). 🚀
    -   Discussion of long-term development opportunities (e.g., advancement to Senior Coach or technical lead).
-   **Format:** 1-hour meeting via `Slack` video call, followed by a written summary. 📄

### 4. 📝 Feedback Templates

To facilitate constructive feedback, we use the following structure:

-   **Structure:**
    -   👍 **Positive:** "What you did well and how it specifically contributed to the project."
    -   🤔 **Area for Improvement:** "What could be done differently next time and why it would be better."
    -   🆘 **Support:** "How can we (the project/manager) help you succeed going forward?"
-   **Example (for a Developer):**
    -   **Positive:** "You delivered the `VedAstro` integration on time and with high code quality, which was crucial for strengthening the MVP."
    -   **Area for Improvement:** "The documentation for the API integration could be more detailed to facilitate the onboarding of new team members."
    -   **Support:** "We can schedule a short workshop on best practices for technical documentation if you are interested." 📚

### 5. 🎉 Rewards and Follow-up

-   **Rewards:** For exceptional performance or contributions, the following may occur:
    -   Public recognition in the `#general` `Slack` channel (e.g., "A big thank you to [Name] for securing the important Vinnova grant! 🥳").
    -   Potential extra time off (1-3 days) 🏖️ or a small bonus (e.g., a 500 SEK gift card) 💰, depending on the project's budget and the impact of the achievement.
-   **Follow-up:** 💬 If set goals are not met:
    -   Focus on an open dialogue about the reasons (e.g., unclear requirements, lack of resources, external obstacles).
    -   Joint development of an action plan for the next quarter, without assigning blame. The goal is learning and improvement. 🌱

## 👥 Link to Roles

Performance goals are specific and adapted to each individual's role and responsibilities:

-   **Developers:** Focus on technical deliveries, code quality, adherence to deadlines, and contribution to the technical architecture. 💻
-   **Coaches:** Assessed primarily on user feedback, the quality of guidance, and the number of completed sessions (see relevant KPI documents). 🧘‍♀️
-   **Funding Manager:** Evaluated against set funding goals and milestones (e.g., securing 2,230,332 SEK according to the funding plan). 📊

## 🛠️ Tools and Resources

The following tools and resources support the process:

-   **The Platform:** `Dynamisk Journal` is used for employees to log individual progress and personal reflections on goals. 📓
-   **Slack:** Used for 1:1 meetings (video), quick feedback (DM), and public recognition (`#general`). 💬
-   **Documents:** Relevant goal documents, project plans, and role descriptions form the basis for goal setting and evaluation. 📄

## 👉 Next Steps

-   This process will be formally introduced during onboarding for new employees and at the first quarterly meeting in 2025. 🏁
-   Feedback on the performance management process itself will be collected continuously. A formal evaluation is planned after Q2 2025 to identify potential areas for improvement and ensure the process adds value for everyone. 👂
