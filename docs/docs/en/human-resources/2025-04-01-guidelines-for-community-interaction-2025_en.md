# 🤝 Community Interaction Guidelines

## 📜 Overview

These guidelines are created to ensure that the Inner Journeys community – including users, coaches, and team members – is characterized by **respect, support, and a practical focus**.

The goal is to foster a safe and productive environment where personal development can flourish. 🌱

The guidelines apply to all interaction that takes place on the Inner Journey platform as well as in associated external channels, such as our shared `Slack` workspace.

## 🎯 Goals of the Guidelines

We strive to:

-   Create a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for all members. 🤗
-   Encourage meaningful and results-driven conversations focused on self-development. 💡
-   Provide clear frameworks for how coaches and team members interact with users and each other. 🧭

## 💬 Interaction Guidelines

Here are specific guidelines for how we communicate and interact within the community.

### Tone and Language

**Ground rule:** Always be respectful, clear, and practical in your communication.

**👍 Good examples (Do's):**

-   Use friendly and encouraging language (e.g., "Great job with that reflection! Here's a suggestion for a next step you could explore."). ✅
-   Stay on topic and avoid unnecessary tangents that don't contribute to development. ✅
-   Be constructive in your feedback. ✅

**👎 To avoid (Don'ts):**

-   Avoid a judgmental or negative tone (e.g., "You should have understood that by now."). ❌
-   Absolutely do not use offensive language, sarcasm, or personal attacks. ❌
-   Avoid generalizations and assumptions about other members. ❌

### Encouraging Engagement

**Goal:** Inspire users to actively participate in their own development journey and contribute positively to the community.

**Methods:**

-   Ask open-ended and reflective questions (e.g., "What was the most important insight you gained from this exercise?" 🤔).
-   Share concrete tips or relevant examples from the platform's features (e.g., "Have you tried the 'Calm Focus' breathing exercise found under `Personal Journeys`? It might be helpful here." 🧘).
-   Acknowledge and celebrate progress publicly when appropriate (e.g., in `#general` on Slack: "Big congratulations to User X for logging 10 reflections in a row! Fantastic engagement! 🎉").

### Handling Conflicts

**Process:** Conflicts can arise, but we handle them constructively.

1.  **Stay calm:** If a conflict, misunderstanding, or criticism arises, respond calmly, factually, and with empathy.
2.  **Move the discussion:** For sensitive or personal discussions, suggest continuing the conversation privately, either via direct message (`DM`) on Slack or via the platform's internal chat function. 🤫
3.  **Escalate if necessary:** If the situation cannot be resolved between the parties, or if it violates the guidelines, contact a certified coach or the project manager (Bo Joel Kvarnsmyr) for mediation and support.

**Example response to criticism:**

> Thank you for sharing your viewpoint. I understand that it can be perceived that way from your perspective. Could we discuss this further in a private message to see how we can find a good solution?

### The Coach's Role in the Community

**Responsibility:** Coaches act as guides and role models.

-   Provide practical advice and support directly linked to the user's journey and the platform's tools (e.g., "Based on what you describe, try using the `Dynamic Journal` to reflect deeper on this pattern.").
-   Keep interactions focused on self-development and the platform's purpose. Avoid pursuing personal agendas or selling external services.

**Boundaries:**

-   Do not give advice in areas requiring specific professional licensing if you lack such (e.g., medical diagnoses, legal advice). Instead, refer to appropriate external resources when necessary. ⚠️

### Team Members' Role

Everyone on the team contributes to a positive community environment:

-   **Developers:** Can share relevant technical updates or answer technical questions in the `#dev` channel. Communicate simply and user-friendly. 💻
-   **Funding Manager:** Can, when necessary, share important updates about the project's status (e.g., funding milestones) in `#general` for transparency. 💰
-   **Project Manager:** Has overall responsibility for the community, ensures guidelines are followed, and handles escalations. 👀

## 🛠️ Tools and Channels

We use the following primary tools and channels for interaction:

-   **Inner Journey Platform:**
    -   Internal chat for direct communication (primarily between coach and user).
    -   Comments on `activations` (exercises/content).
-   **Slack:**
    -   `#general`: For general discussions, announcements, and celebrating progress. 🎉
    -   `#coaching`: For discussions, questions, and experience sharing specifically between coaches. 🧑‍🏫
    -   `#dev`: For technical questions, bug reports, and discussion regarding platform development. 💻
    -   `DM` (Direct Messages): For private conversations, sensitive topics, or conflict resolution. 🤫
-   **Feedback Form:** A dedicated form (link available on the platform) for users and coaches to provide structured feedback. 📝

## ⚠️ Consequences for Violations

To maintain a safe and respectful environment, there is a process for handling violations of these guidelines:

1.  **Warning:** A first violation usually leads to a private reprimand and reminder of the guidelines from a coach or project manager.
2.  **Temporary Suspension:** Repeated or more serious violations can lead to a temporary suspension from community features (e.g., Slack access or comment sections) for a specified period (e.g., 1 week). ⏳
3.  **Permanent Ban:** Serious violations, such as harassment, hate speech, or repeated gross violations of the guidelines, can lead to a permanent ban from the community and possibly the platform, following a decision by the project manager. 🚫

**Documentation:** All formal warnings and actions are documented internally to ensure a fair and transparent process. 🔒
