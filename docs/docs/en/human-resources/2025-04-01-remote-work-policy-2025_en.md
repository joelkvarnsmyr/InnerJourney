## 📜 Overview

This policy defines the framework for how we at Inner Journey work as a distributed team – including developers, coaches, and funding managers.

The policy is designed to:

*   🤸‍♀️ Provide **flexibility** in work.
*   🚀 Promote **productivity** and focus.
*   🗣️ Ensure **smooth communication** and collaboration.
*   💖 Reflect our core values of practical focus and team **well-being**.

## 🎯 Policy Goals

The purpose of this policy is to:

*   ✅ Give employees the freedom to work where and when they are most effective.
*   🤝 Ensure clear communication and good collaboration despite geographical distribution.
*   ⚖️ Balance flexibility with responsibility to achieve the project's common goals and milestones (e.g., MVP launch Q3 2025).

## 🧭 Guidelines for Remote Work

Here are the specific guidelines for how we work remotely within Inner Journey.

### ⏰ Working Hours

Flexibility is fundamental, but collaboration requires some structure:

*   **Flexibility:** Employees fundamentally choose their own working hours based on personal needs, tasks, and deadlines.
*   **Core Hours:** To facilitate meetings and collaboration, common availability during the core hours of **10:00–14:00 (CET)** on weekdays is recommended. 🕰️
*   **Exceptions:** Adjustments to availability during core hours are possible when necessary but must be communicated well in advance via `Slack`.
*   **Responsibility:** Regardless of chosen working hours, each employee is responsible for meeting agreed-upon deadlines according to the project plan.

### 💬 Communication Channels

Clear and effective communication is crucial for a distributed team:

*   **Primary Channel:** `Slack` is our central hub for all asynchronous communication.
    *   `#general`: For general team updates, important announcements, and positive recognition. 🎉
    *   `#dev`: For technical discussions, code questions, and development-related topics. 💻
    *   `#coaching`: For topics specifically related to coaching, user interactions, and the platform's coaching features. 🤝
    *   `#finance`: For updates and questions regarding funding, budget, and financial processes. 💰
    *   `DM` (Direct Messages): Used for private messages, quick personal questions, or matters that do not concern the entire team/channel. 🤫
*   **Video Calls:** Used for synchronous meetings such as:
    *   Regular 1:1 meetings.
    *   Weekly team updates (aim for a maximum of 1 hour/week for the entire team). 📹
*   **Response:** Expected response time in `Slack` during workdays is within **24 hours**, unless the matter is marked as urgent or otherwise agreed. ⏳

### 🛠️ Collaboration Tools

We use the following tools to work effectively together:

*   **The Platform:** Inner Journey's proprietary platform is central for reflection, goal tracking, and coach interactions. 🎯
*   **Technical Tools:**
    *   Development: `Python`, `React`, `Firebase`, `Google Cloud Engine (GCE)` (specifically the `VedAstro` project). 👨‍💻
    *   Documentation: *[Tool for technical documentation, e.g., Docusaurus]* 📝
    *   Document Management: `Google Drive` or equivalent cloud service for shared files (e.g., *[Policy documents, meeting notes]*). 📂
    *   Agreement Signing: Digital agreements are handled via an integrated tool (e.g., `Paperbell` or `DocuSign`). ✍️
*   **Communication:** `Slack` (see above) and a common tool for video conferencing (e.g., `Google Meet`, `Zoom`).

### 🏠 Work Environment and Equipment

A functional and ergonomic work environment is important, even remotely:

*   **Personal Responsibility:** Each employee is responsible for creating and maintaining their own workspace that is safe and functional. This includes:
    *   A stable and sufficiently fast internet connection. 🌐
    *   A quiet environment when needed (especially during meetings and focused work). 🤫
*   **Support from Inner Journey:** We provide necessary digital tools and licenses (e.g., accounts for `Slack`, `Firebase`, development tools).
*   **Equipment Budget:** 💰 A **one-time budget** of up to **SEK 2,000** per employee is available for purchasing work-related equipment that enhances remote work (e.g., headset 🎧, webcam, ergonomic support). Purchases must be pre-approved by the project manager.
*   **Internet Recommendation:** A stable internet connection with at least **20 Mbps** download speed is strongly recommended to ensure good video call quality and efficient technical work. 👍

### ❤️ Balance and Well-being

We value the team's health and strive for a sustainable workload:

*   **Availability:** There is **no expectation** to be available or respond to messages outside of individually chosen and communicated working hours. Exceptions apply only in **urgent, critical situations** requiring immediate action (e.g., serious operational disruptions affecting users before a launch). 🧘‍♀️
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Flexible Time Off:** We encourage taking necessary time off for personal matters or recovery, in dialogue with the project manager.
    *   **Extra Recovery Days:** In addition to statutory vacation, **5 extra paid days per year** ✨ are offered, specifically intended for recovery or personal development related to well-being (see separate information *[link to benefits document]*). 🔋
*   **Support for Overload:** If you experience stress, high workload, or signs of burnout, you are encouraged to raise this with the project manager **as soon as possible** (e.g., via `Slack DM` or in a 1:1 meeting) to jointly find solutions and adjust the workload. 🆘

## 🚀 Implementation

How the policy is introduced and followed up within the team:

*   **Onboarding:** New employees review this policy as part of their onboarding. This includes practical instructions for setting up and using our primary tools (`Slack`, project tools, etc.) and a review of communication guidelines. 🎓
*   **Follow-up:** The policy's effectiveness and any challenges are discussed regularly, including during quarterly 1:1 meetings (see 1:1 template *[link to template]*). Continuous feedback from the team is welcome. 📊
*   **Adjustments:** The policy will be evaluated and adjusted as needed after Q3 2025, in conjunction with the evaluation of the MVP launch. The aim is to ensure it continues to support the team's needs, project goals, and a sustainable way of working. 🔧

## ✅ Next Steps

To ensure everyone is ready to work effectively according to this policy:

1.  **Configure Tools:** All current and new employees are responsible for configuring necessary accounts and tools, including `Slack` access and profile settings, by the end of their first work week (see onboarding checklist *[link to checklist]*). ⚙️
2.  **Ask Questions and Provide Feedback:** Any questions, concerns, or suggestions for improvement regarding this policy are welcome! Use the `#general` `Slack` channel for open discussions or send a `DM` directly to the project manager for more specific or sensitive matters. 🤔
