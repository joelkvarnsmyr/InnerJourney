## üß≠ Overview

The Recruitment Guide is created to ensure that we find and onboard individuals who share our vision of practical self-development and user focus within Inner Journey.

The guide covers the entire process, from defining roles to welcoming new talent aboard. We are initially focusing on the following roles:

*   üíª Developers
*   üßò Coaches
*   üí∞ Funding Manager (e.g., for grant applications)

## üéØ Recruitment Goals

Our primary goals for the recruitment process are to:

*   Attract practically minded individuals who value clear results and smart design.
*   Build a team that reflects our primary and secondary target audience: self-improvers and people seeking concrete tools for change.
*   Ensure a culture characterized by curiosity, transparency, and user-centered development. ‚ú®

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Recruitment Process

The process follows these main steps:

### 1. Define the Role üìù

*   **Responsible:** HR manager or project manager (e.g., Bo Joel Kvarnsmyr).
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Identify the specific need (e.g., backend developer, certified coach, person for funding).
    2.  Create a detailed requirements profile based on both technical and psychographic characteristics (see section below).
    3.  Determine if the role should be internal (team member) or external (e.g., certified coach working on assignment).
*   **Prioritized roles right now:**
    *   üí∞ **Funding Manager:** A person who proactively takes the lead in seeking funding for the project, including writing and submitting grant applications.
    *   üíª **Developer:** Backend and/or frontend developer to build and maintain the platform.
    *   üßò **Coaches:** Certified or aspiring coaches who can guide and support our users.

### 3. Writing the Job Advertisement üì¢

    1.  **Introduction:** Brief about Inner Journey (e.g., "We are building a platform for practical self-development ‚Äì without finger-pointing.").
    2.  **The Role:** Description of responsibilities, tasks, and expectations.
    3.  **Qualifications:** Clear requirements ("must-haves") and desirable merits ("nice-to-haves").
    4.  **Application:** Instructions on how to apply, preferably via an integrated form in Inner Journey's system (see suggested services below). State the application deadline.
*   **Example Ad (Funding Manager):**

### 4. Selection Process üîç

*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Screening:** Review incoming applications and match them against the requirements profile.
    2.  **First Interview:** Conduct a shorter interview (approx. 30 min, via video or in person) to assess basic match, motivation, and cultural fit.
    3.  **Practical Task:** Give relevant candidates a practical task to solve (e.g., write a draft grant application, solve a small coding task, create a simple coaching plan for a given scenario).
    4.  **Final Interview:** In-depth interview, often with more team members, to ensure technical/practical competence, collaboration skills, and long-term commitment.
*   **Timeline:** Strive for an efficient process, max 2 weeks from the application deadline to decision. ‚è±Ô∏è

### 5. Offer and Agreement ‚úçÔ∏è

*   **Content:** Clarify role description, responsibilities, salary/compensation model, start date, any conditions for remote work, and other relevant employment terms.
*   **Compensation for coaches:** For external coaches, the model can be a combination of a reduced monthly price for premium access to the platform and a separate session-based compensation. üí∞
*   **Signing:** Use a digital signing tool for smoothness and efficiency. Preferably one that can be integrated with Inner Journey's system (see suggestions below).
*   **Note:** By handling agreements digitally directly in our system, we save time, reduce administration, and ensure a professional process. ‚úÖ
