## 🎯 Purpose

This user flow document for `InnerJourney` aims to detail the user's journey through the platform. The journey includes the first interaction, the `onboarding` process, the creation of a personal profile, and the completion of the initial exercises (so-called `activations`).

The goal is to provide a clear and concise picture of the user experience and the steps involved in this initial process.

For a broader context regarding the project, see the document `Project Description: Inner Journey`.

## 🗺️ User Flow

The user's journey in `InnerJourney` begins with a streamlined and engaging `onboarding` process. This process is designed to smoothly collect necessary information and verify the user. Based on this, a personal `profile` is created which customizes the experience, after which the user is introduced to their first `activations`.

The main steps in the flow are:

1.  📥 **Onboarding:**
    *   The user starts the process by entering basic data.
    *   This occurs via an interactive `AI`-driven form or a conversational experience (chat).
    *   Specific questions are asked to build a basic user `profile`.

2.  👤 **Profile Creation:**
    *   A personal `profile` is automatically generated based on the information collected during `onboarding`.
    *   The profile determines which initial exercises (`activations`) and features are presented to the user.

3.  💪 **Initial Exercises (`Activations`):**
    *   The user is guided through completing two specific `activations`.
    *   These provide a first tangible experience of the platform's core value and functionality.
    *   *For detailed information about the exercises, see the document `Activations: Inner Journey`.*

4.  🧭 **Continued Journey:**
    *   After completing the initial exercises, the user is encouraged to continue exploring the platform.
    *   This includes discovering more `activations`, logging personal reflections, and potentially interacting with other users via the social network (`The Net`).

## 🚀 Next Steps

The following activities are planned to iterate and improve this user flow:

*   ✏️ **Visualization:** Create a detailed flowchart in `Draw.io` or `Figma`. This diagram will visually represent the user flow and is planned for `Q2 2025`.
*   🧪 **User Testing:** Conduct usability tests of the current flow with at least 10 representative users. This is planned during `Sprint 4` and aims to collect qualitative feedback.
*   🔄 **Iteration:** Analyze collected feedback from the user tests. Based on the analysis, the design and flow will be iterated to optimize the user experience. This work is planned for `Sprint 5`.
