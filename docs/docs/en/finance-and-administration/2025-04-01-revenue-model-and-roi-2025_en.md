# Revenue Model and ROI

## 🎯 Purpose

This document describes Inner Journey's revenue model and estimates potential revenue based on a freemium strategy. We also calculate the return on investment (ROI) and the expected time to break-even.

The goal is to provide project managers, investors, and other stakeholders with a clear view of the project's financial potential and long-term sustainability.

## 💵 Revenue Model: Freemium

Inner Journey plans to use a **freemium model** to generate revenue. This means we offer both a free and a paid version of the service.

### 🆓 Free Version

*   **Content:** Access to basic meditation exercises 🧘‍♀️ and a limited amount of astrological insights ✨.
*   **Purpose:** Attract a broad user base, build engagement, and create a funnel for conversion to premium.

### 💎 Premium Version

*   **Price:** `99 SEK/month`.
*   **Content:** Full access to all exercises 📚, in-depth personal insights, future coaching features 🚀, and exclusive community features 💬.
*   **Purpose:** Generate recurring revenue from our most engaged users.

## 📈 Revenue Forecast (First Year)

The forecast is based on the following assumptions and calculations for the first 12 months after launch.

### 🔢 Assumptions

*   **User Growth:** We aim to reach 10,000 registered users within the first 12 months, assuming linear growth from launch.
*   **Conversion Rate (Free to Premium):** We estimate that `10%` of the total user base will convert to premium subscribers. This corresponds to 1,000 paying users by the end of year 1.
*   **Monthly Revenue (at end of year 1):** 1,000 premium users × `99 SEK/user` = `99,000 SEK/month`.

### 🧮 Calculation: Total Revenue Year 1

Revenue is expected to grow gradually as the user base increases and more users convert to premium. The calculation below uses a simplified linear model:

*   **Average Monthly Revenue:** (`0 SEK` at start + `99,000 SEK` at month 12) / 2 = `49,500 SEK/month`.
*   **Total Estimated Revenue for the First Year:** `49,500 SEK/month` × 12 months = `594,000 SEK`.

## 📊 ROI and Break-Even

Here, we analyze the expected return on investment (ROI) and when the project is expected to reach break-even (zero profit).

### 💸 Total Investment (Year 1)

The total initial investment during the first year consists of:

*   **Development Costs (fixed):** `931,730 SEK`
*   **Operating Costs (recurring, 12 months):** `926,880 SEK`
*   **Total Investment (Year 1):** `1,858,610 SEK`
    *   _(See `Budget` for a detailed cost breakdown)._

### 📉 Net Result (Year 1)

Based on projected revenue and total costs for the first year:

*   **Estimated Revenue:** `594,000 SEK`
*   **Total Costs:** `1,858,610 SEK`
*   **Net Result (Year 1):** `594,000 SEK` - `1,858,610 SEK` = `-1,264,610 SEK`

### ⏳ Break-Even Calculation

Break-even occurs when accumulated revenue covers total costs (initial investment + recurring costs).

*   **Assumptions after year 1:**
    *   Monthly Revenue (stable level): `99,000 SEK/month` (based on 1,000 premium users).
    *   Monthly Operating Costs (stable level): `77,240 SEK/month` (`926,880 SEK / 12`).
*   **Monthly Surplus (after year 1):** `99,000 SEK` - `77,240 SEK` = `21,760 SEK/month`.
*   **Time to cover initial loss:**
    *   Remaining deficit after year 1 (total investment - revenue year 1): `1,858,610 SEK` - `594,000 SEK` = `1,264,610 SEK`.
    *   Number of months to cover the deficit with the surplus: `1,264,610 SEK` / `21,760 SEK/month` ≈ 58.1 months.
*   **Total time from project start to break-even:** 12 months (initial phase) + 58 months (recovery phase) ≈ **70 months** (approximately 5.8 years).

> **📝 Note:** This is a simplified calculation based on assumptions of linear growth, a constant conversion rate, and stable costs/revenue after year 1. Reality may vary. If the user base, conversion rate, or price increases faster than assumed, break-even could be reached significantly earlier.

## ✨ Improvement Opportunities

To improve ROI and potentially shorten the time to break-even, the following strategies can be considered:

*   💰 **Increase the premium price:**
    *   If the price is set to `149 SEK/month`, the monthly revenue (with 1,000 users) would increase to `149,000 SEK`.
    *   This yields a monthly surplus of `71,760 SEK` (`149,000 - 77,240`).
    *   Potential break-even time: approximately **30 months** (12 + `1,264,610` / `71,760` ≈ 12 + 17.6).

*   📈 **Increase the conversion rate:**
    *   If `15%` of users convert (1,500 premium users by the end of year 1), the monthly revenue would become `148,500 SEK` (at the `99 SEK` price).
    *   This yields a monthly surplus of `71,260 SEK` (`148,500 - 77,240`).
    *   Potential break-even time: approximately **30 months** (12 + `1,264,610` / `71,260` ≈ 12 + 17.7).

*   🛠️ **Reduce operating costs:**
    *   Continuous optimization of cloud services, infrastructure, and processes can lower recurring costs.
    *   _(See `Services and Technical Infrastructure` for details on the current setup)._

## 📝 Summary

Based on the current business model and assumptions, the key financial figures for the first year are:

*   **Estimated Revenue (Year 1):** `594,000 SEK`.
*   **Total Investment (Year 1):** `1,858,610 SEK`.
*   **Estimated Time to Break-Even:** Approximately **70 months** (5.8 years) ⏳.

The project's long-term financial success is highly dependent on our ability to:

1.  ✅ Quickly build an engaged user base.
2.  ✅ Effectively convert free users to paying premium customers.
3.  ✅ Optimize pricing and/or control costs over time.
