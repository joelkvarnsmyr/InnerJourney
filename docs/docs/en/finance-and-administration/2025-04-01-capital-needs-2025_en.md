# 💰 Capital Requirement

## 🎯 Purpose

This document specifies the total capital requirement to finance the development and operation of **InnerJourney** during the first 12 months. This also includes a buffer to manage unforeseen costs.

The purpose is to provide project managers, investors, and other stakeholders with a clear and transparent overview of the financial need to ensure the project's successful launch and initial growth phase.

For detailed cost breakdowns and revenue forecasts, see the following documents:

*   📄 **Cost Details:** `Budget`
*   📈 **Revenue Forecasts:** `Revenue Model and ROI`

## 📊 Capital Requirement: First Year (12 months)

To cover all identified costs for development and operation during the first year of operation, as well as to maintain financial stability, the following capital is required:

### 🧱 Components

The capital requirement is divided into three main components:

*   **🏗️ Development Costs (MVP):**
    *   **Estimate:** `931,730 SEK`
    *   **Includes:** Costs for personnel (development team), external services, necessary infrastructure (including `VedAstro-server`), and initial costs such as domain purchase for `innerjourney.com`.
    *   **Source:** Detailed specification available in `Budget` (v1.1).

*   **⚙️ Operating Costs (12 months):**
    *   **Estimate:** `926,880 SEK`
    *   **Includes:** Ongoing costs for personnel (operations and support), services (`API`s, licenses), and infrastructure (servers, maintenance) to support up to `1000` active users per month.
    *   **Source:** Detailed specification available in `Budget` (v1.1).

*   **🛡️ Buffer (20% of total costs):**
    *   **Calculation:** (`931,730 SEK` [Development] + `926,880 SEK` [Operations]) * 20% = `1,858,610 SEK` * 0.2 = `371,722 SEK`
    *   **Purpose:** To cover unforeseen costs and manage risks. Examples include potentially higher prices when negotiating for the `innerjourney.com` domain, unexpectedly increased server costs due to faster user growth, or minor delays in development work.

### ➕ Total Capital Requirement

The summarized calculation for the total capital requirement is:

*   Development Costs (`MVP`): `931,730 SEK`
*   Operating Costs (12 months): `926,880 SEK`
*   Buffer (20%): `371,722 SEK`
*   **🎯 Total requirement:** **`2,230,332 SEK`** 💰

## 📈 Context and Funding

To put the capital requirement into perspective:

*   📉 **First-year revenue:** The estimated revenue during the first year is calculated at `594,000 SEK` (see `Revenue Model and ROI` for details). This covers approximately `32%` of the total costs (excluding the buffer).
*   🏦 **Net requirement:** The external funding requirement during year 1 thus becomes `2,230,332 SEK` (Total requirement) - `594,000 SEK` (Estimated revenue) = **`1,636,332 SEK`**.
*   ✅ **Goal:** The requested capital should ensure the project's operation and continued development until the point where ongoing revenues exceed ongoing operating costs. According to the forecast (see `Revenue Model and ROI`), a monthly surplus of `21,760 SEK` is achieved starting from month 12.

## 💸 Use of Capital

The raised capital will be allocated according to the following plan:

1.  **🏗️ Sprint 1-5 (approx. 3 months):** Primary focus on financing the development of the Minimum Viable Product (`MVP`). Allocation: `931,730 SEK`.
2.  **⚙️ Month 4-12:** Cover ongoing operating costs (`926,880 SEK`) during the period when the user base is being built and revenue streams are established.
3.  **🛡️ Buffer (`371,722 SEK`):** Used as needed to manage unforeseen events and ensure project continuity. This provides necessary flexibility to handle risks such as negotiations regarding the `innerjourney.com` domain or unexpected technical challenges.

## ✨ Summary

*   💰 **Total capital requirement for the first year:** **`2,230,332 SEK`**

This amount is necessary to ensure that InnerJourney can be developed, launched successfully, and operated stably during the critical first year, including an important buffer for financial security and risk management.
