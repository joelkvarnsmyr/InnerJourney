# 📝 Test Plan for Inner Journey

Here is information about this document:

*   ✨ **Version:** 3
*   🗓️ **Date:** `2025-03-21`
*   👤 **Author:** Bo Joel Kvarnsmyr
*   ✍️ **Last revised by:** Bo Joel Kvarnsmyr

## 🎯 Purpose

This test plan aims to ensure that all components of the `Inner Journey` project function correctly and according to specification.

This includes tests of:
*   Frontend
*   Backend
*   External integrations
*   The `Dialogflow CX` conversation flow

The main goal is to identify and document any bugs or functional deficiencies before the launch of new features, such as the integration with `Firebase`.

## 💻 Test Environment

The following components and addresses constitute the test environment:

*   🌐 **Frontend:** The `React` application runs locally at `http://localhost:3000`. For external access, `ngrok` is used (example address: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`).
*   ☁️ **Backend:** The `FastAPI` application is accessible via `https://api.backend.kvarnsmyr.se`.
*   📞 **Phone Number:** A dedicated test number (`+447418631211`) is used via the `Sinch Voice API`.
*   💬 **Dialogflow CX:** The AI agent is configured and managed via the `Google Cloud Console`.

## ✅ Test Cases

Below are specific test cases covering the system's core functionality.

### 🖥️ Frontend

1.  **Test Case: User data entry**
    *   **Steps:** 👟 Fill in the `personalNumber`, `birthTime`, and `verificationCode` fields in the form. Then click the `"Begin Journey"` button.
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ Data is sent correctly to the `/init-verification` backend endpoint. A phone call is initiated to the specified test number. 👍

2.  **Test Case: Entering the received verification code**
    *   **Steps:** 👟 After receiving the code via the phone call, enter it into the designated field. Click the `"Verify Code"` button.
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ The code is sent to the `/verify-code` backend endpoint for validation. If the code is correct, the conversation flow continues as expected. 👍

### 🗣️ Conversation (Dialogflow CX)

1.  **Test Case: Correct AI messages**
    *   **Steps:** 🎧 Initiate a test call. Listen carefully to the messages delivered by the AI agent at different stages of the conversation flow.
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ The agent should deliver the following messages at the respective stages:
        *   `StartPage`: "Hello!"
        *   `SecureLine`: "First of all..."
        *   `userReady`: Waits for user confirmation ("Yes").
        *   `VerifyCode`: "Your verification code is 123456..." (Note: The actual code provided will vary). 👍

2.  **Test Case: Voice confirmation in the `userReady` stage**
    *   **Steps:** 🗣️ When the AI agent is in the `userReady` stage and waiting for input, respond clearly with "Yes".
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ The conversation flow should correctly transition to the next stage, `VerifyCode`. 👍

### ⚙️ Backend (API Endpoints)

1.  **Test Case: Call initiation via `/init-verification`**
    *   **Steps:** 🚀 Use `curl` to send a `POST` request to the endpoint with the necessary data:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://api.backend.kvarnsmyr.se/init-verification \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -d '{"personalNumber": "19900101-1234", "verificationCode": "123456", "birthTime": "14:30"}'
        ```
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ The API should return a JSON response indicating that the initiation has started: `{"status": "Verification initiated"}`. 👍

2.  **Test Case: Code validation via `/verify-code`**
    *   **Steps:** 🚀 Use `curl` to send a `POST` request to the endpoint, including a valid `sessionId` and the received `code`:
        ```bash
        curl -X POST https://api.backend.kvarnsmyr.se/verify-code \
             -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -d '{"sessionId": "abc123", "code": "123456"}'
        ```
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ The API should return a JSON response confirming the validation: `{"status": "Code verified"}`. 👍

### 🧘 Exercises

1.  **Test Case: Completion of the Hemisync exercise**
    *   **Steps:** 🎧 Use the frontend interface to start and listen through the audio file for the Hemisync exercise. ✍️ After the exercise, write and save a reflection via the interface.
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ The reflection is successfully sent to the `/save-reflection` backend endpoint and saved. 👍

2.  **Test Case: Completion of the "Bridge The Gap" exercise**
    *   **Steps:** 🎬 Use the frontend interface to watch the video for the "Bridge The Gap" exercise. ✍️ After the exercise, write and save a journal entry about the experience via the interface.
    *   **Expected Result:** ✅ The journal entry is successfully sent to the `/save-reflection` backend endpoint and saved. 👍

## 🧪 Test Methods

The following methods are used to conduct the tests:

*   🖐️ **Manual Testing:** Primarily used to:
    *   Verify user interactions and flows in the frontend.
    *   Evaluate the quality and correctness of the conversation flow via `Dialogflow CX`.
*   🤖 **Automated Testing:** The backend API's endpoints are tested using `pytest`. The tests are run from the terminal with the following command:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_endpoints.py
    ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Steps

If issues arise during testing, follow these steps to identify the cause:

*   **Frontend:** 🔍 Inspect the browser's developer tools. Specifically check:
    *   Console logs (`Console`) for JavaScript errors.
    *   Network traffic (`Network`) for failed calls or unexpected responses from the backend.
*   **Backend:** 📜 Review the logs from the `FastAPI` application on the server. Use `journalctl`, for example:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u fastapi.service -n 50
    ```
*   **Conversation:** 📊 Analyze the conversation logs directly in the `Google Cloud Console` for `Dialogflow CX`. This helps track the agent's execution and identify any logic errors or integration issues.
*   **Network:**
    *   📡 Isolate backend issues by testing API endpoints directly with tools like `curl`.
    *   🛡️ If `Nginx` is used as a reverse proxy, check its error logs for potential configuration or connection problems:
        ```bash
        sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/fastapi_error.log
        ```
