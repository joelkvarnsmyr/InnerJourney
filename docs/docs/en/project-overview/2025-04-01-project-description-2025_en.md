# 📝 Project Description

**Project Details:**

- ✨ **Version:** 0.7
- 📅 **Date:** 2025-03-24
- 👤 **Author:** Bo Joel Kvarnsmyr

## 💡 Overview & Unique Value Proposition

Inner Journey is a platform for self-development that combines practical exercises, reflection, and social interaction. The goal is to help users grow and manage everyday challenges – without fluffy promises.

Through a personal onboarding process and a customizable interface, the experience becomes tailored and engaging. Users can explore exercises, log reflections, and connect with others, all presented in a modern and user-friendly way.

## 🎯 Defined Target Audience for Launch

To effectively develop and reach out with Inner Journey, the following target audiences are prioritized:

- **👥 Primary Target Audience:** Individuals actively working on self-improvement – e.g., coaches, entrepreneurs, or individuals already using tools like meditation or journaling. They appreciate tools that make everyday life more meaningful and effective.
- **👤 Secondary Target Audience:** Individuals who feel stuck in routines and are seeking concrete ways to break patterns, improve their well-being, or find a new direction – without necessarily being 'spiritual'.

### ✨ Shared Psychographic Traits

The target audiences share the following characteristics:

- Practically minded, curious, and open to trying new tools for personal development.
- Attracted by clear results, smart design, and a sense of control over their own journey.
- Value both individual reflection and the opportunity to connect with others.

## 🚀 Main Features & Concept

Inner Journey is built to provide users with practical tools for self-development, adapted to their lives and needs. Here are the three main features at launch:

- 🗺️ **Personal Journeys:** Users can create tailored plans based on their goals – whether it's reducing stress, finding focus, or exploring new habits. The platform guides them step-by-step with exercises and reflections.
- ✍️ **Dynamic Journal:** A smart journal feature that suggests questions and themes based on the user's previous insights, making reflection both deeper and more meaningful.
- 🛠️ **Integrated Tools:** Combines meditation, goal setting, and progress tracking into a seamless experience – all designed to give the user control over their development without hassle.

### 📌 The Concept in Brief

Inner Journey is a flexible companion for self-insight, designed to meet users where they are and help them take the next step – without preaching or fluff.

For technical details, see [Feature Specification](#).

## 💰 Payment Models

Inner Journey offers a flexible payment structure to suit different user needs:

- 🆓 **Free Version:** Provides access to basic exercises and journal features.
- ⭐ **Premium Version:** Unlocks advanced exercises and personal plans for a deeper experience.
- 💳 **Subscription-Based Payment:** Monthly or annual subscriptions for premium features, with discounted rates for longer commitments.

For more information, see the [Payment Models Document](#).

## 🤝 Coaching

Coaching is a natural part of the journey in Inner Journey. As a user, you can grow to become a coach, supporting new or existing users without a coach – a step that both helps others and deepens your own development.

Coaches work together with their users through shared tasks, and certified coaches can also guide other coaches.

For more information, see [Coaching Strategy](#).

## 📣 User Feedback & Communication Strategy

Inner Journey is built to grow with its users. We collect feedback through a simple button in the app that links to a short form. 📝

We stay in touch via email and a community channel. This allows us to quickly capture users' thoughts and make ongoing improvements. Transparency and user focus are key to an engaged user base. 💬

For more information, see [User Feedback Strategy](#).

## 💻 Technical Implementation (Summary)

Inner Journey is built to be smooth and secure. We use `Python` for the backend and `React` for the frontend, making the platform available as a Progressive Web App (`PWA`) on all devices. 📱

`Firebase` handles authentication and data storage, while `AI` and chat tools enhance the experience. 🤖

**Tech stack includes:**

- Backend: `Python`
- Frontend: `React` (`PWA`)
- Infrastructure: `Firebase` (authentication, database)

## 🌱 Initial MVP Launch Strategy

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of Inner Journey focuses on a stable foundation with:

- 🔒 Authentication
- 👋 Simple Onboarding
- 📅 Daily Logging

We are launching with a few core exercises, such as breathing for focus and reflection tasks. The interface is clean, inspired by tools like `Typeform` and `Superhuman`. User feedback will be crucial in shaping the next steps of development.

## 🌟 Future Vision & Growth Strategy

Inner Journey aims to become a leading platform for practical self-development, where users can take control of their well-being and goals. ✨
